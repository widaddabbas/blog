title: how to lose your generality
tags: 
---

In 2023 I completed one project in category theory and another in theoretical ecology accidentally making generality my home. The trouble with a home as massive as generality is that I have forgotten the way out;<!--more--> despite knowing there can be no whole without it's parts, I have forgotten how to intuit the value of specifics[^1].

Determined to provoke macroscopic change and interdisciplinary connections, it was reasonable that my motives trended towards the general. Though by now, I have deserted the specifics which may yield the most general good[^2]. Beyond this, a lack of specifics has hindered my ability to take action, for how can one climb a mountain without using it's holds, does one expect to fly? Thus, to recover my non-generality, I will start by remapping a specific book *Cognitive Hypnotherapy* by a specific individual *Trevor Sylvester*.

## Engineering Placebos 

Trevor Sylvester's notion of cognitive hypnotherapy is strikingly reasonable, with the idea that “believing nothing to be true sets you free, because then everything needs to be only be useful” at it's forefront.

##### Problem patterns

[^1]: In an abuse of pure mathematics, absolute truth can become a similar home which forgets the value in what I shall term "emergent truth".
[^2]: Apart from moral ambitions, an aversion to specifics can also get in the way of higher level academic and career aspirations.
