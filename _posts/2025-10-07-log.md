title: how to lose your generality
tags: philosophy
---

In 2023 I completed one project in category theory and another in theoretical ecology accidentally making generality my home. The trouble with a home as comfy as generality is that I have forgotten how to leave;<!--more--> despite knowing there can be no whole without it's parts, I have forgotten how to intuit the value of specifics[^1] **_*problem state_**.

Determined to provoke macroscopic change and interdisciplinary connections, it was reasonable that my motives trended towards the general for some time. The problem with this state however, is that engaging with specifics is a skill that often yields general good[^2]. Beyond this, an aversion to specifics has hindered my ability to take action, for how can one climb a mountain without using it's holds, does one expect to fly? Thus, to extend my home into non-generality, I will begin with mapping a specific book *Cognitive Hypnotherapy* by a specific individual *Trevor Sylvester*.

## Engineering Placebos 

Trevor Sylvester's notion of cognitive hypnotherapy is strikingly reasonable, with the idea that “believing nothing to be true sets you free, because then everything needs to be only be useful” at it's forefront. This idea on beliefs is restricted to ones' illusion of the world or _reality tunnel_, for it is evolved from a causal model deemed _The Algorithms Of The Mind_ (TAOTM) which takes some composition of the remembered past, percieved present and imagined future as input. Sylvester further asserts that our sense of self is an illusion -a useful though not yet entirely convincing view- as such, manipulating TAOTM should allow us to directly mould ourselves and our perception of reality.


### Problem states
there is a problem state and a solution state

### Trance phenomena
there are trance phenomena in which those states exist

### Problem patterns
these may inform the following problem patterns

### Techniques
put it all together to determine the approach of technique(s), noting that some may overlap between problem states and in general they are not exhaustive, but wordweaving is key


[^1]: In an abuse of pure mathematics, absolute truth can become a similar home which forgets the value in what I shall term "emergent truth".
[^2]: Apart from moral ambitions, an aversion to specifics can also get in the way of higher level academic and career aspirations.
