title: how to lose your generality
tags:

In 2023 I completed one project in category theory and another in theoretical ecology accidentally making generality my home. The trouble with a home as massive as generality is that I have forgotten the way out;<!--more--> despite knowing there can be no whole without it's parts, I have forgotten how to intuit the value of specifics[^1].

Determined to incite macroscopic change and interdisciplinary connections, it was reasonable that my motives trended towards the general. Though by now, I have deserted the specifics which may yield the most general good[^2]. Beyond this, a lack of specifics has hindered my ability to take action, for how can one climb a mountain without using it's holds, does one expect to fly? Thus, to recover my non-generality, I will start by mapping a specific book *Cognitive Hypnotherapy* by a specific individual *Trevor Sylvester*.

## Sylvester's Cognitive Hypnotherapy 









[^1]: In an abuse of pure mathematics, I have similarly made absolute truth my home, thus forgetting the value in what I shall term "emergent truth".
[^2]: Apart from moral ambitions, my aversion to specifics has also got in the way of my academic and career aspirations.
