title: how to lose your generality
tags: philosophy
---

In 2023 I wrote one paper on category theory and another in theoretical ecology, accidentally making generality my home. The trouble with a home as big as generality is that I struggle to ever leave;<!--more--> despite knowing there can be no whole without it's parts, I have forgotten how to pursue specifics[^1].

Determined to provoke macroscopic change and interdisciplinary connections, it was reasonable that my motives trended towards the general for some time. The problem with this state however, is that engaging with specifics is a skill which often yields wider good; even in the science of generalising complex systems[^2], one must employ particular models and tools. Beyond this, my aversion has hindered my ability to take action. Think of the generality of talking about going for a walk, versus the specificity of setting one foot in front of the other to actually walk it. In reality a balance must be struck whereby "talking" induces reflection and synthesis, whilst "walking" allows for application and testing.

So, please enjoy this step by step account of a specific book _-Cognitive Hypnotherapy[^3]-_ by a specific individual _-Trevor Silvester-_.

## we are placebos (TAOTM)

Trevor Silvester's notion of cognitive hypnotherapy is strikingly reasonable, with the idea that “believing nothing to be true sets you free, because then everything needs to be only be useful” at it's forefront. This idea on beliefs is restricted to ones' illusion of the world or _reality tunnel_, claimed to evolve from a causal model deemed _The Algorithms Of The Mind_ (TAOTM) which take some composition of the remembered past, percieved present and imagined future as input. Bricks of a reality tunnel are thus the sensory distortions output by TAOTM called _trance phenomena_[^4], and contradicted my expectations in that they need not describe deep altered states. Rather, one is in a hypnotic trance whenever their attention is not strictly in the present. 

According to Silvester, these trances are also responsible for ones' sense of self, such that manipulating TAOTM should allow us to directly mould ourselves through our perception of reality. Consider for example how your behaviour and sensory experience is altered when you stumble upon a beautiful sunset - life seems to slow down (time distortion) and you stop in place, forgetting what you were doing before looking up (amnesia), you might even notice a dragon dancing in the clouds (positive hallucination) that brings back your childhood smile (age regression).

But now one might ask, "how am I expected to reach into my mind and purposefully manipulate its' algorithms?". To which I might respond, "first you must reach into a particular problem state **_-I freeze or "talk"-_** and identify a specific solution state **_-I "walk"-_** that you desire in response to the problem stimulus **_-when attempting to "walk"-_**. From there it is a process of honing in on the underlying patterns[^5], following which the appropriate interventions can be applied. The book maps these out rather systematically[^6], yet remains mindful that a mind can be fooled in many ways. In fact, interventions might often adress multiple patterns depending on what one believes will be useful, depending on one's willingness or primacy to respond to a certain placebo.

To maximise success, Silvester gives us a most universal key with the art of wordweaving[^7]. Alternatively referred to as the science of suggestion, this concept is self explanatory and builds upon patterns in neuro-linguistic programming with which words may be woven to better sculpt any reality tunnel. Most enjoyable about this method, is that although it recognises the importance of submodalities[^8] (SMD's) it doesn't require their explicit understanding for effective communication between perceptive qualities. Instead of suggesting one "think of the colour associated to surprise" for instance, a wordweaver might ask one to "think back to a time when you were surprised and notice what quality associates to the feeling" such that the SMD needs only it's function to be understood.

### walking the walk (Interventions)

Putting this knowledge to use in a coherent example, I will attempt to resolve my problem state as an important bid towards self congruence.

_**1. Problem Pattern**_ When attempting to learn or create something specific and encountering any obstacle, I assume my lack of knowledge or skills are the hinderance and seek to blindly tackle those first (this is dysfunctional as the process of continuing to engage often results in necessary things being learned or created).
<!--Extending our walking metaphor, this looks like the need to plan every tep of the route rather than trusting the mapmaker and simply placing my feet infront of one another at which point walking in the environment will give me all the necessary details that the mapmaker knew when attempting to guide me and which I did not know when failing to create my own map.-->

_**2. Solution State**_
_**3. Intervention**_

To navigate through possibly infinite interpretations of problems, solutions and interventions, I shall follow the cascaade model whilst keeping in mind that indeed there is nothing to optimise but delusion.
1- what is the pattern that underlies the problem "what's that about?"
2- in what quadrant does the problem pattern lie 
3- as a result of the information uncovered a decision is made about which intevention is best suited to the clients outcome "how can i use that?"
4- at some point the client my resist the techniue : context issue (wont) vs structure issue (cant)
5- return to the first question





**(1) Dropthrough** 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
we extnd the metaphor: into WLOG#2 to say that without attempting to walk one will not ideantify their walking weakenesses as such their talking is inherently void. likewise if one continuously changes direction as they walk they are sure to get nowhere whereas walking in a straight line will certainly reach some destination and may feel not nice at first but should at least wait until warmed up. this is to say that discussing methods is meaningless without somewhere to apply them. rather you must seek out a problem first then create or find the methods most suitable to the solution and resources at hands

identifying the associated trance phenomena **_-(1) dissociation (2) age progression to blindly walking in a straight line_-** as well as the underlying problem patterns **_-structure and consequence-_**. i.e. my walking muscles have atrophed s.t. WLOG is about building those muscles
