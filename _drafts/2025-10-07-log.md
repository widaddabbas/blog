title: how to lose your generality
tags: philosophy
---

In 2023 I wrote one paper on category theory and another in theoretical ecology accidentally making generality my home. The trouble with a home as big as generality is that I struggle to ever leave;<!--more--> despite knowing there can be no whole without it's parts, I have forgotten how to pursue specifics[^1].

Determined to provoke macroscopic change and interdisciplinary connections, it was reasonable that my motives trended towards the general for some time. The problem with this state however, is that engaging with specifics is a skill that often yields a wider good; even in the science of generalising complex systems[^2], one must employ precise models and tools. Beyond this, my aversion has hindered my ability to take action. Think of the generality of talking about going for a walk, versus the specificity of setting one foot in front of the other to actually walk it. In reality a balance must be struck whereby "talking" induces reflection and synthesis, whilst "walking" allows for application and testing.

To remedy my imbalance and inaugurate WLOG, I will employ a specific book _Cognitive Hypnotherapy_[^3] by a specific individual _Trevor Sylvester_ as follows.

## we are placebos

Trevor Sylvester's notion of cognitive hypnotherapy is strikingly reasonable, with the idea that “believing nothing to be true sets you free, because then everything needs to be only be useful” at it's forefront. This idea on beliefs is restricted to ones' illusion of the world or _reality tunnel_, claimed to evolve from a causal model deemed _The Algorithms Of The Mind_ (TAOTM) which take some composition of the remembered past, percieved present and imagined future as input. Bricks of a reality tunnel are thus the sensory distortions output by TAOTM called _trance phenomena_[^4], and contradicted my expectations in that they need not describe deep altered states. Rather, one is in a hypnotic trance whenever their attention is not strictly in the present. According to Sylvester, these trances are also responsible for ones' sense of self, such that manipulating TAOTM should allow us to directly mould ourselves through our perception of reality. Consider for example how your perception of time alters your behaviour and your sensory experience - you may find that when you are in a rush you percieve time to be going faster than you can keep up (time distortion), this might lead you not to see your keys when they are right infront of you (negative hallucination) or forget what exactly you were trying to find (amnesia). **if using this example link back to a time when you were often late and had consequences? though a positive example would be cooler: you eat your favorite childhood food and suddenly the world seems big again and you feel young and behave more giddily and time freezes as you take a bite**

But now one might ask, 'how am I expected to reach into my mind and manipulate its' algorithms?'. To which I might respond, 'first you must reach into a particular problem state **_-I freeze or "talk"-_** and identify a specific solution state **_-I "walk"-_** that you desire in response to the problem stimulus **_-when attempting to "walk"-_**'. From there it is a process of honing in on the underlying patterns[^5], following which one can apply the appropriate interventions. The book maps these out rather systematically[^6], yet remains mindful that the mind is easy to manipulate. such that interventions can move between patterns depending on what you believe will be useful i.e. depending on your willingness/primacy to respond to a certain placebo. 

the importance of wordweaving to success. also the importnce of SMDs and that we've already been using them ad that we need not know them because wordweaving

### walking the walk

from here on I will play out the resolution of my problem state as an example and a turning point. some explanations will accompany and follow this section

we extnd the metaphor: into WLOG#2 to say that without attempting to walk one will not ideantify their walking weakenesses as such their talking is inherently void. likewise if one continuously changes direction as they walk they are sure to get nowhere whereas walking in a straight line will certainly reach some destination and may feel not nice at first but should at least wait until warmed up. this is to say that discussing methods is meaningless without somewhere to apply them. rather you must seek out a problem first then create or find the methods most suitable to the solution and resources at hands

identifying the associated trance phenomena **_-(1) amnesia for taking steps with feet (2) age progression to blindly walking in a straight line_-** as well as the underlying problem patterns **_-structure and consequence-_**. i.e. my walking muscles have atrophed s.t. WLOG is about building those muscles


This may seem similar to the notion of replacing a harmful habit with a non-harmful one, except that it works by changing your perception of the stimulus as it occurs. Identifying apropriate interventions then relies on parsing out the associated trance phenomena **_-(1) amnesia for taking steps with feet (2) age progression to blindly walking in a straight line_-** as well as the underlying problem patterns[^5] **_-structure and consequence-_**. 

In the spirit of placebos, many of the interventions happen to be interchangable depending on your perception.

#### interventions

At this point, I will give a brief interlude to conceptualise SMDs, wordweaving and post hypnotic suggestion.

SMD... WE HAVE ALREADY GIVEN THE STATES THE SMD OF WALKING AND TALKING! very sneaky. s.t. amnesia of how to walk => how to solve examples, no turning => crippled by expertise.

**_*(1) I recall a specific that I enjoyed working on and the results (2) I remain in the present since the future is unpredictable the trance is like anxiety OR age progression to a future where i use my specific skills for general good (3) positive hallucinations_** This follows the logic of finding a good habit to replace a harmful one, yet as you may know, harmful habits often rise in an response to some stimulus. So, rather than working to replace the habit we instead work to identify the trance phenomena s.t. we can replace the initial peception of the stimulus to prevent the need of the habit itself. 

**_*COMBINE THE AMNESIA AS A CNOSEQUECE OF THE PROGRESSION TO SHOW MYSELF THAT NOT HAVING SPECIFICS HAS PRESENTLY CRIPPLED ME? I need to understand that being an expert is not crippling_**


It is key to note that lack of presence need not be bad if it is useful.

At this point, we may go deeper into the problem and find that as the trances are narrowed into specificity the solutions follow, this is okay as long as we have our guidelines. to pick apart a problem state we must find its problem pattern of which there are 4 - list - then describe the meaning of  problem pattern in that it helps the motivation of the state thus guides our use of techniques. for the remainder of this post, I will tackle the trance of age progression crippled by specificity OR fear that i dont yet have the whole picture. **_*The pattern is consequence_**.

put it all together to determine the approach of technique(s), noting that some may overlap between problem states and in general they are not exhaustive, but wordweaving is key

Ideally one with highest vertex degree in the graph of all problem states.


I omit some details here and elsewhere so as not to rob Sylvester of potential students.   If you have ever tried to stop a bad habit, you will find a big piece of advice is to find a good habit with whih to replace it until the core driver is resolved.
