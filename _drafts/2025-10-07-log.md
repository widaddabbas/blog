title: how to lose your generality
tags: philosophy
---

In 2023 I completed one project in category theory and another in theoretical ecology accidentally making generality my home. The trouble with a home as comfy as generality is that I have forgotten how to leave;<!--more--> despite knowing there can be no whole without it's parts, I have forgotten how to intuit the joy of specifics[^1] **_*Problem State_**.

Determined to provoke macroscopic change and interdisciplinary connections, it was reasonable that my motives trended towards the general for some time. The problem with this state however, is that engaging with specifics is a skill that often yields general good[^2]; even in the science of generalising complex systems[^3], one must employ specific models and tools. Beyond this, an aversion to specifics has hindered my ability to take action. Think of the generality of talking about going for a walk, versus the specificity of setting one forr in front of the other to actually walk it.

for how can one climb a mountain face without using it's holds, does one expect to fly? Thus, to extend my home into non-generality, I will begin with a specific book *Cognitive Hypnotherapy*[^4] by a specific individual *Trevor Sylvester*.

## engineering placebos 

Sylvester's notion of cognitive hypnotherapy is strikingly reasonable, with the idea that “believing nothing to be true sets you free, because then everything needs to be only be useful” at it's forefront. This idea on beliefs is restricted to ones' illusion of the world or _reality tunnel_, claimed to evolve from a causal model deemed _The Algorithms Of The Mind_ (TAOTM) which take some composition of the remembered past, percieved present and imagined future as input. Bricks of a reality tunnel are thus the sensory distortions output by TAOTM called _trance phenomena_, and contradicted my expectations in that they need not describe deep altered states. Rather, one is in a hypnotic trance whenever their attention is not strictly present. **_*When I am proposed an unfamiliar non-general endeavour I experience the following trances (1) amnesia of good specifics (2) age progression to a future crippled by specificity (3) absence of positive hallucinations enjoyed with general propositions._**

The above example includes 3 of the 9 defined trance phenomena[^5], which -according to Sylvester- make up the further illusion that is one's sense of self. As such, manipulating TAOTM should allow us to directly mould ourselves and our perception of reality. By now one might ask, 'how am I expected to reach into my mind and manipulate its algorithms?'. To which I might respond, 'first you must reach into a particular problem state[^6] and identify a specific solution state that you would prefer to experience in response to the problem stimulus'[^7]. **_*(1) I recall a specific that I enjoyed working on and the results (2) I remain in the present since the future is unpredictable the trance is like anxiety OR age progression to a future where i use my specific skills for general good (3) positive hallucinations_** This follows the logic of finding a good habit to replace a harmful one, yet as you may know, harmful habits often rise in an response to some stimulus. So, rather than working to replace the habit we instead work to identify the trance phenomena s.t. we can replace the peception of the stimulus as well as the habit itself. and mention the high degree vertex.

At this point, we may go deeper into the problem and find that as the trances are narrowed into specificity the solutions follow, this is okay as long as we have our guidelines. to pick apart a problem state we must find its problem pattern of which there are 4 - list - then describe the meaning of  problem pattern in that it helps the motivation of the state thus guides our use of techniques. for the remainder of this post, I will tackle the problem of age progression crippled by specificity. **_*The pattern is consequence_**.

### Techniques
put it all together to determine the approach of technique(s), noting that some may overlap between problem states and in general they are not exhaustive, but wordweaving is key
