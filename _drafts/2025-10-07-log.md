title: how to lose your generality
tags: philosophy
---

In 2023 I wrote one paper on category theory and another in theoretical ecology, accidentally making generality my home. The trouble with a home as big as generality is that I struggle to ever leave;<!--more--> despite knowing there can be no whole without it's parts, I have forgotten how to pursue specifics[^1].

Determined to provoke macroscopic change and interdisciplinary connections, it was reasonable that my motives trended towards the general for some time. The problem with this state however, is that engaging with specifics is a skill which often yields wider good; even in the science of generalising complex systems[^2], one must employ particular models and tools. Beyond this, my aversion has hindered my ability to take action. Think of the generality of talking about going for a walk, versus the specificity of setting one foot in front of the other to actually walk it. In reality a balance must be struck whereby "talking" induces reflection and synthesis, whilst "walking" allows for application and testing.

So, please enjoy this account of a specific book _-Cognitive Hypnotherapy[^3]-_ by a specific individual _-Trevor Silvester-_ as I relearn how to walk.

## we are placebos (TAOTM)

Trevor Silvester's notion of cognitive hypnotherapy is strikingly reasonable, with the idea that “believing nothing to be true sets you free, because then everything needs to be only be useful” at it's forefront. This idea on beliefs is restricted to ones' illusion of the world or _reality tunnel_, claimed to evolve from a causal model deemed _The Algorithms Of The Mind_ (TAOTM) which take some composition of the remembered past, percieved present and imagined future as input. Bricks of a reality tunnel are thus the sensory distortions output by TAOTM called _trance phenomena_[^4], and contradicted my expectations in that they need not describe deep altered states. Rather, one is in a hypnotic trance whenever their attention is not strictly in the present. 

According to Silvester, these trances are also responsible for ones' sense of self, such that manipulating TAOTM should allow us to directly mould ourselves through our perception of reality. Consider for example how your behaviour and sensory experience is altered when you stumble upon a beautiful sunset - life seems to slow down (time distortion) and you stop in place, forgetting what you were doing before looking up (amnesia), you might even notice a dragon dancing in the clouds (positive hallucination) that brings back your childhood smile (age regression).

But now one might ask, "how am I expected to reach into my mind and purposefully manipulate its' algorithms?". To which I might respond, "first you must reach into a particular problem state **_-I freeze or "talk"-_** and identify a specific solution state **_-I "walk"-_** that you desire in response to the problem stimulus **_-when attempting to "walk"-_**". From there it is a process of honing in on the underlying patterns[^5], following which the appropriate interventions can be applied. The book maps these out rather systematically[^6], yet remains mindful that a mind can be fooled in many ways. In fact, interventions will often adress multiple patterns depending on what one believes will be useful, depending on one's willingness or primacy to respond to a certain placebo.

To maximise success, Silvester gives us a most universal key with the art of Wordweaving[^7]. Alternatively referred to as the science of suggestion, this concept is self explanatory and builds upon patterns in neuro-linguistic programming with which words may be woven to better sculpt any reality tunnel. What I find stands out about this method, it that although it recognises the importance of submodalities[^8] (SMD's) it doesn't require their explicit understanding. Given that SMD's are the audio, visual or kinaesthetic qualities which form our perceptions of a thought, this allows one to create effective suggestions despite differing perceptive qualities.

### walking the walk (Interventions)

Equipped with this knowledge, I will now play out the resolution of my problem state as an example and a turning point.

To navigate through possibly infinite interpretations of problems, solutions and interventions, I shall follow the cascaade model whilst keeping in mind that indeed there is nothing to optimise but delusion.
1- what is the pattern that underlies the problem "what's that about?"
2- in what quadrant does the problem pattern lie 
3- as a result of the information uncovered a decision is made about which intevention is best suited to the clients outcome "how can i use that?"
4- at some point the client my resist the techniue : context issue (wont) vs structure issue (cant)
5- return to the first question




specifying the **problem state** => when i attempt to interact with something specific with hopes of learning or creating at the first encounter of non-understanding or lack of context I assume i know nothing and stop the task in searh of context or depth despite the fact that by completing the object t hand i will likely gain much better understanding and despite the fact that the necessarry context etc is often contained in subsequent parts of interating with the task. i.e. when attempting to walk i need to plan every tep of the route rather than trusting the mapmaker and simply placing my feet infront of one another at which poiunt walking in the environment will give me all the necessary details that the mapmaker knew when attempting to guide me and which i did not know when failing to create my own map.
**(1) Dropthrough** 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
we extnd the metaphor: into WLOG#2 to say that without attempting to walk one will not ideantify their walking weakenesses as such their talking is inherently void. likewise if one continuously changes direction as they walk they are sure to get nowhere whereas walking in a straight line will certainly reach some destination and may feel not nice at first but should at least wait until warmed up. this is to say that discussing methods is meaningless without somewhere to apply them. rather you must seek out a problem first then create or find the methods most suitable to the solution and resources at hands

identifying the associated trance phenomena **_-(1) dissociation (2) age progression to blindly walking in a straight line_-** as well as the underlying problem patterns **_-structure and consequence-_**. i.e. my walking muscles have atrophed s.t. WLOG is about building those muscles


This may seem similar to the notion of replacing a harmful habit with a non-harmful one, except that it works by changing your perception of the stimulus as it occurs. Identifying apropriate interventions then relies on parsing out the associated trance phenomena **_-(1) amnesia for taking steps with feet (2) age progression to blindly walking in a straight line_-** as well as the underlying problem patterns[^5] **_-structure and consequence-_**. 

In the spirit of placebos, many of the interventions happen to be interchangable depending on your perception.

At this point, I will give a brief interlude to conceptualise SMDs, wordweaving and post hypnotic suggestion.

SMD... WE HAVE ALREADY GIVEN THE STATES THE SMD OF WALKING AND TALKING! very sneaky. s.t. amnesia of how to walk => how to solve examples, no turning => crippled by expertise.

**_*(1) I recall a specific that I enjoyed working on and the results (2) I remain in the present since the future is unpredictable the trance is like anxiety OR age progression to a future where i use my specific skills for general good (3) positive hallucinations_** This follows the logic of finding a good habit to replace a harmful one, yet as you may know, harmful habits often rise in an response to some stimulus. So, rather than working to replace the habit we instead work to identify the trance phenomena s.t. we can replace the initial peception of the stimulus to prevent the need of the habit itself. 

**_*COMBINE THE AMNESIA AS A CNOSEQUECE OF THE PROGRESSION TO SHOW MYSELF THAT NOT HAVING SPECIFICS HAS PRESENTLY CRIPPLED ME? I need to understand that being an expert is not crippling_**


It is key to note that lack of presence need not be bad if it is useful.

At this point, we may go deeper into the problem and find that as the trances are narrowed into specificity the solutions follow, this is okay as long as we have our guidelines. to pick apart a problem state we must find its problem pattern of which there are 4 - list - then describe the meaning of  problem pattern in that it helps the motivation of the state thus guides our use of techniques. for the remainder of this post, I will tackle the trance of age progression crippled by specificity OR fear that i dont yet have the whole picture. **_*The pattern is consequence_**.

put it all together to determine the approach of technique(s), noting that some may overlap between problem states and in general they are not exhaustive, but wordweaving is key

I omit some details here and elsewhere so as not to rob Silvester of potential students.   If you have ever tried to stop a bad habit, you will find a big piece of advice is to find a good habit with whih to replace it until the core driver is resolved.
