title: how to lose your generality
tags: philosophy
---

In 2023 I completed one project in category theory and another in theoretical ecology accidentally making generality my home. The trouble with a home as comfy as generality is that I have forgotten how to leave;<!--more--> despite knowing there can be no whole without it's parts, I have forgotten how to intuit the value of specifics[^1] **_*problem state_**.

Determined to provoke macroscopic change and interdisciplinary connections, it was reasonable that my motives trended towards the general for some time. The problem with this state however, is that engaging with specifics is a skill that often yields general good[^2]; even in the practice of generalising complex systems[^3], one must employ specific models and tools. Beyond this, an aversion to specifics has hindered my ability to take action, for how can one climb a mountain face without using it's holds, does one expect to fly? Thus, to extend my home into non-generality, I will begin with a specific book *Cognitive Hypnotherapy* by a specific individual *Trevor Sylvester*.

## engineering placebos 

Sylvester's notion of cognitive hypnotherapy is strikingly reasonable, with the idea that “believing nothing to be true sets you free, because then everything needs to be only be useful” at it's forefront. This idea on beliefs is restricted to ones' illusion of the world or _reality tunnel_, claimed to evolve from a causal model deemed _The Algorithms Of The Mind_ (TAOTM) which take some composition of the remembered past, percieved present and imagined future as input. Bricks of a reality tunnel are thus the sensory distortions output by TAOTM called _trance phenomena_, and contradicted my expectations in that they need not describe deep altered states. Rather, one is in a hypnotic trance whenever their attention is not strictly present **_*when I am proposed an unfamiliar non-general endeavour I experience the following trances (1) amnesia of good specifics (2) age progression to a future crippled by specificity (3) absence of positive hallucination enjoyed with general propositions_**

The above example includes 3 of the 9 defined trance phenomena. Sylvester further asserts that our sense of self is an illusion -a view I find useful though not yet entirely convincing- as such, manipulating TAOTM should allow us to directly mould ourselves and our perception of reality. By now one might ask 'how am i expected to reach into my mind and manipulate its algorithms?' to which i respond 'first you must reach into the problem and identify its replacement' i.e. one must find a problem state (ideally one with highest vertex degree in the map of all states) and identify a solution state rather than simply the absence of the problem.

### Problem states
there is a problem state and a solution state

### Problem patterns
these may inform the following problem patterns

### Techniques[^4]
put it all together to determine the approach of technique(s), noting that some may overlap between problem states and in general they are not exhaustive, but wordweaving is key

### Post hypnotic suggestion

[^1]: In an abuse of pure mathematics, absolute truth can become a similar home which forgets the value in what I shall term "emergent truth".
[^2]: Apart from moral ambitions, an aversion to specifics can also get in the way of higher level academic and career aspirations.
[^3]: Complexity science book (add bibliography)
[^4]: I will omit so not to rob Sylvester of students
