"Measure theory had been recently developed to resolve the technical conflict between the intuitive idea "every region in the plane has some area" and the axioms of set theory dealing with every subset of an uncountable set" - https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/Real_World/kolmogorov.html


the technical machinery of measure theory applies automatically to probability. for probability is concerned with measuring the area of an event from a unit. the philosophical question then asks "in what contexts is it both possible and useful to try to assign numerical probabilities to uncertain events"

Kolmogrov axioms:
- first, making a model requires you to prespecify all the relevant events that might happen and assign a probability to every combination of happen/not happen
and you really can't do that except in very limited contexts: consider our geopolitical forecasting examples.
- Second, comparing dice probabilities with geopolitical forecasting 
we are more confident about our abilities to assess probabilities accurately in some contexts than in others
and this "uncertainty about probabilities" is hard to fit into the axiomatic framework.
- Third, a probability model is a description of how data is produced, not a prescription for when observed data can be regarded as "random"
whereas our everyday perception of randomness is centered on actual observations.

Then a random variable is simply any function of omega, and we can think of **P** as a measure on OMEGA and **E**(xpectation) as an integral with respect to **P**. with omega an abstract outcome in an outcome space OMEGA..
