"Measure theory had been recently developed to resolve the technical conflict between the intuitive idea "every region in the plane has some area" and the axioms of set theory dealing with every subset of an uncountable set" - https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/Real_World/kolmogorov.html


the technical machinery of measure theory applies automatically to probability. for probability is concerned with measuring the area of an event from a unit. the philosophical question then asks "in what contexts is it both possible and useful to try to assign numerical probabilities to uncertain events"
