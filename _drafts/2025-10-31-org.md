It has been an insightful few days masquerading as a biologist at the ISSSB. You would think the study of biological systems would be my forte, but it seems I am more suited to the organismal approach to these things than the numeric; a funny conclusion given my start, though unsurprising given my mathematical favorites either.

To pick apart the structures and functions of an organism is so simple and playful compared to the issues with trying to track millioins of articles that make up our macrocosm.

however, i have also learned that i seem to lack the key concepts of evolutionary biology.


though i have come to the scary conclusion that in fact mathematical biology seems not to be a biological discipline rather a puzzle with a theoretical motivation
